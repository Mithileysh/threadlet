Depositions must be taken of you and Tonya.2.  We must send discovery to Tonya and we must have sufficient timepursuant to the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure for it to be answered priorto trial.3.  The Court will require mediation before we can go to trial.4. The Court will appoint a mental health examiner and possible an attorneyad litem to represent Payton s best interests.This is now a case where custody and possession are an issue and these stepsMUST be taken before we can proceed to trial.  Initially, after paternitywas established and you first visited with Payton, your desire was that allpossession periods would be worked out by agreement and neither you norTonya wanted any more court proceedings.  However, since then, Tonya hasbucked your every request for visitation and put limitations of one kind oranother on it, turning the case into a custody case.  Without discovery toTonya (similar to the discovery we answered for you) and Tonya s depositionand a mental health evaluation, we are not prepared for trial and the Courtwould not be ready to hear the case and entertain what was in Payton s bestinterest.  Therefore, Mr. Fullenweider did not opposed Stewart Gagnon smotion for continuance, and would have, in fact, have filed one himself inkeeping with your best interest (and Payton s) in mind.As I explained, we are working on a Request for Temporary Orders, which Iexpect will be set on 11/14/01, along with the hearing on mentalevaluations.  At that time, I expect the court to set your possessionperiods with Payton, including holidays.  Until then, we must work onscheduling your possession periods by agreement.To confirm your November 3rd visitation period, you have chosen to havePayton from 12:00 noon to 7:00 p.m. in Vero Beach on the 3rd and will foregoNovember 4th. Where will you pick up and drop off Payton?Jonda-----Original Message-----From: Joe.Stepenovitch@enron.com [mailto:Joe.Stepenovitch@enron.com]Sent: Tuesday, October 23, 2001 9:05 AMTo: jls@fullenweider.comSubject: RE: StepenovitchGood Morning Jonda,I received the papers from you yesterday about the continuance.  I wasunder the impression that it was the court moving the date.  It looks liketo me its Tonya and her Lawyer.  They have been doing pushing this caseback from the start and I m sure they are doing this for a reason (to sayto the jury: that a bond has been created and its not in the best interestof the child to go with his father after being with his mother for so long)At this point if we go to trial Payton will be 1 year old and I will haveonly seen him about 12 times.  I don t think I will win that battle!As for the November 12th court date will we have something in writing bythe judge so I can start having my rights!  I feel like her and her lawyercan tell us what to do and we must follow there rules.  Will this change ordo I have to go through this until the April court date?  That can t be howis system works.  I should have the right to pick my own son up whenever Iwant and no court or lawyer or even his mother should have anything to sayabout that.  I don t understand why everything is against me?Finally,  for the weekend of Nov 1st I will take my son for the whole day(in Vero) on Saturday and forego Sunday.-Joe    -----Original Message-----   From:   Jonda Stowell <jls@fullenweider.com>@ENRON   Sent:   Friday, October 19, 2001 3:33 PM   To:     Stepenovitch, Joe   Subject:  Stepenovitch   Dear Joe:   I just received a phone call from Miryam  Mitchell.

I am very concerned to learn that only a part (approximately 1/3 or $680,000) was allocated out to EGS units as part of Steve Kean s budget.  (A disproportionately high $600,000 was allocated to EGM and the remaining $738,000 was retained at corp.)  It is my understanding that $470,000 was budgeted for the ETS communications group.  Recognizing that my proposed corp. budget already reflected a decrease of approximately $ 1 million from the 2001 budget and $5 million from its 2000 budgets, it will be tight, but we could do our work as an EGS group if we were able to get the EGS allocations ($680,000), ETS communications budget ($470,000) and the portion that was unallocated corp. ($738,000), for a total of $1,888,000.  I presume the problem with this is that it includes $738,000, which was not allocated to EGS entities.  Do you think this can be accommodated or should we look at keeping the budget at corp., with a reporting line to Stan?  (I have not broached this with Stan.)  I ve attached spreadsheets with my corp. budget and Gina Taylor s ETS budget.  When you have time, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this with you.Thanks,John   -----Original Message-----From: \tGeaccone, Tracy  Sent:\tWednesday, October 24, 2001 11:56 AMTo:\tAmbler, JohnSubject:\tRE: 2002 Plan Lay Presentation Run Through Have the Steve Kean numbers been included in his budget and allocated out for 2002?ThanksTracy -----Original Message-----From: \tAmbler, John  Sent:\tWednesday, October 24, 2001 11:37 AMTo:\tGeaccone, TracySubject:\tRE: 2002 Plan Lay Presentation Run Through Tracy,Thank you!

The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We ll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the \"Gridiron Guru.\"   \t[IMAGE]\tInside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   \t [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  \t    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you re in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  \t    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player s statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who s been getting the most consistent production.  \t    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we ll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You ll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   \t  Question - Mike Blake     I m having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he s risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he s losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week s opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  \t  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde s Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets  conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won t have an easier time against Oakland. We d suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   \t  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he s far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can t bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman s matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   \t    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday.

We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com>. You ll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! Question - Mike Blake I m having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten? Answer - GG Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he s risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he s losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week s opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad. Question - Russell Brown My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady, Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie. Answer - GG Testaverde s Fantasy value has taken a real hit this season because of the Jets  conservative offense. Flutie struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and won t have an easier time against Oakland. We d suggest playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in his last five games, and is playing too well to bench. Question - Chris Gilcrest Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson, Curtis Martin? Answer - GG Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but he s far too inconsistent to start over a player like Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike Anderson. You can t bench Martin, no matter how bad the matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his struggles this season; and Pittman s matchup against Detroit is too good to ignore.   _____  Tip of the Week Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

Mike Blake: I m having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten? G.G. - Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he s risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he s losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week s opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad. Russell Brown: My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady, Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.   G.G. - Testaverde s Fantasy value has taken a real hit this season because of the Jets  conservative offense. Flutie struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and won t have an easier time against Oakland. We d suggest playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in his last five games, and is playing too well to bench. Chris Gilcrest: Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson, Curtis Martin?

Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   \t [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  \t    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you re in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  \t    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player s statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who s been getting the most consistent production.  \t    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we ll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You ll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   \t  Question - Mike Blake     I m having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he s risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he s losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week s opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  \t  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde s Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets  conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won t have an easier time against Oakland. We d suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   \t  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he s far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can t bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman s matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   \t    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday.

The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We ll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the \"Gridiron Guru.\"   \t[IMAGE]\tInside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   \t [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  \t    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you re in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  \t    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player s statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who s been getting the most consistent production.  \t    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we ll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You ll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   \t  Question - Mike Blake     I m having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he s risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he s losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week s opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  \t  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde s Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets  conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won t have an easier time against Oakland. We d suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   \t  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he s far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can t bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman s matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   \t    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.    \t  This message has been sent to jane.m.tholt@enron.com, provided free of charge and free of obligation.

I have worked through a couple of examples of this under collection issue with Jeff and we agree, Edison s  argument  that the DA load contributed to the under collection is \"technically\" correct.   We will have to work with Jeff to build a compelling argument that ESP s should not be required to continue to contribute to the under collection, especially as of March 31, 2002, the end of the rate freeze as required in AB 1890.   Somehow we have to convince \"the regulators\"  that the original intent of the de-reg bill, that utilities recover what they can through no later than March, 02,  stay in place for the current DA load.

They are wanting to discuss completely different issues than PG&E   To date, PG&E issues have been focused around the outcome of the FERC refund case. I have worked through a couple of examples of this under collection issue with Jeff and we agree, Edison s  argument  that the DA load contributed to the under collection is \"technically\" correct.   We will have to work with Jeff to build a compelling argument that ESP s should not be required to continue to contribute to the under collection, especially as of March 31, 2002, the end of the rate freeze as required in AB 1890.   Somehow we have to convince \"the regulators\"  that the original intent of the de-reg bill, that utilities recover what they can through no later than March, 02,  stay in place for the current DA load.

They are simple wrong.  Unless and until we get all of our \"positive\" CTC back from the Utility, why should I even begin to consider their \"goofy\" arguments.  In addition, SCE is receiving $3.3 B which is a full payment of all Negative CTC.  If their issue is to have a Undercollection charge against all customers, that s a different policy matter.  The CPUC agreed to the idea of Negative CTC and SCE needs to pay.  Also, if we are 5% of load and the Undercollection is $3.3 B, I think that SCE would be looking for $165 MM - our entire claim.

Would it be as simple as to determine their total (around $3 billion?) and  gross receivable (before any payments - 145 million) and calculate the % (around 5%)?  This would result in a pretty small percentage.  Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis.  If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st,   this % (5.7%)  would also be very small.  How do you think they will look at it?

Power Marketing and Project development2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertiseGiven the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don t want to make this email a novel!Thanks a lot.303-575-6473"}]}, {"threadId": "e9bebeb8a35f113", "messages": [{"messageId": "e9bbed20125bd47", "subject": "CBS SportsLine's Fantasy Basketball 2001 is now live!", "sender": "noreply@ccomad3.uu.commissioner.com", "time": "2001-10-23T16:37:40-07:00", "recipients": [{"email": "mcuilla@enron.com", "type": "TO"}], "body": "Just a note to let you know that CBS SportLine.com s FantasyBasketball 2001 and Basketball Commissioner are both on-line.FANTASY BASKETBALL 2001 - Presented by Hondahttp://www.sportsline.com/links/6/1/87/fantasybbNUM2102301.cgi* The best game for those looking to join a league and  compete for great prizes.* Stats and standings updated daily; reports available  via e-mail or wireless.* Each team gets a private web site, including tons of  scouting reports and fantasy analysis.* This year, $150 goes to the champion of every Fantasy  Basketball GOLD league.BASKETBALL COMMISSIONER - Presented by Hondahttp://www.sportsline.com/links/6/1/87/fantasybb102301.cgi* The best league management and stats service to run  an existing league, or start a private league on-line.* You make all the rules for scoring, drafting, playoffs,  prizes and more.* We calculate all the stats and standings for you.* We give you all the tools you need, including tons of  statistics, scouting reports and analysis.* Enjoy great perks with Commissioner GOLD---------------------------------------------------------------------This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.If you prefer not to receive emails of this nature please send an email to remove@commissioner.com.

Marcus Howell: Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?G.G. - Griese s receiving corps has been crippled by injuries this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has never been able to string many good performances together in the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post respectable numbers at Dallas.Eric Fernau: Which three running backs should I start?  I have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest Holmes and Garrison Hearst.G.G. - Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside. Staley should have little trouble ripping through the Washington front wall. It s hard to ignore Hearst at Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon, Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.Jay Rassat: Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).G.G. - Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play. Green will be facing a Seattle team that won t offer much of a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady. With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we ll go with the New England QB.FANTASY FOOTBALL GUIDESWant to win your Fantasy League?

I would not be surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky s a great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a back like Alexander.SPORTING NEWSAttention Fantasy Fans!

Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday s first kickoff.

We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You ll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! Marcus Howell: Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?G.G. - Griese s receiving corps has been crippled by injuries this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has never been able to string many good performances together in the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post respectable numbers at Dallas.Eric Fernau: Which three running backs should I start?  I have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest Holmes and Garrison Hearst.G.G. - Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside. Staley should have little trouble ripping through the Washington front wall. It s hard to ignore Hearst at Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon, Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.Jay Rassat: Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).G.G. - Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play. Green will be facing a Seattle team that won t offer much of a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady. With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we ll go with the New England QB.FANTASY FOOTBALL GUIDESWant to win your Fantasy League?

I would not be surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky s a great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a back like Alexander.SPORTING NEWSAttention Fantasy Fans!

It is very draft in nature but I wanted to get the working version over to you ASAP.  I wanted to get this discussion going via written format so that I (or others who may implement this) can stay focused on what you want and not get into broader research, etc....I think I can put a model together if we can define what parameters, the interface (levers) and model (transfer functions) to use that would be useful for you as phase I product.I will fire off updates to this document as I make them.  If you have a spec doc or ideas that you want to hand write on a print out, please do so and I will update the document. I will like to make sure that I am on the same page before beginning to code the program and to start linking to additional moths (month 2, 3, ..) and different curves, etc.My Job search has gone well with the Crude desk and I am waiting compensation indication from them to make my decision. Also, Kevin Presto feels that I could potentially help his power group with new market or spread trading.  John Suarez is a director who came from the power desk to EBS is going back to work for Kevin Presto.  I may have an opportunity to build the southeast market by supporting John.I am very grateful that I met you and other key Enron traders during this job search.   << File: Neural Ideas.ppt >> Ravi Thuraisingham, CFADirector, Storage TradingEnron Broadband Servicesp  713.853.3057c  713.516.5440pg 877.680.4806ravi.thuraisingham@enron.com -----Original Message-----From: \tArnold, John  Sent:\tMonday, October 01, 2001 3:47 PMTo:\tThuraisingham, RaviSubject:\tRE: Neural Networksnot necessarily looking for predictive power.  that s a 3 year project.  just for market making skillset.

I will try to send you a few power point slides showing my initial thoughts on the system.It appears that neutral network (AI is a subset of this class of learning systems) type of model that takes input from all available sources (including actual market feedback, weather and other fundamentals) and uses curve building functions and other existing tools as transfer functions, along with your own thinking (your processing functions that your neurons are wired up to do), could help the neural network to learn and eventually provide the necessary predictive power.

We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You ll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA: Which two receivers should I start this weekend: Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Terry Glenn or James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?G.G. - As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he s a must-start against a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards and three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we d have to go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To answer your second question, we d recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carolina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It s tough to choose Davis, but Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at best, so our hands are tied. Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL: I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye this week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weinke. What do you recommend?G.G. - Miller has been very inconsistent from a Fantasy perspective, so we d have to side with Weinke. He ll be facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a big game.Scott Buzby, Newark, DE: Who should I start this week: Shannon Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin Johnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still available.G.G. - Franks has been Brett Favre s favorite target in the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sharpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we highly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he s just not good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after another No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fantasy player. MVP.comStay warm this postseason with your MLB Team Turtleneck.

He is the best offensive option the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk after five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes will continue to be a productive player all season.

You ll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA Which two receivers should I start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Terry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins? Answer - GG As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he s a must- start against a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards and three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we d have to go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To answer your second question, we d recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carolina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It s tough to choose Davis, but Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at best, so our hands are tied. Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye this week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weinke. What do you recommend? Answer - GG Miller has been very inconsistent from a Fantasy perspective, so we d have to side with Weinke. He ll be facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a big game. Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE Who should I start this week: Shannon Sharpe or Bubba Franks? Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin Johnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still available. Answer - GG Franks has been Brett Favre s favorite target in the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sharpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we highly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he s just not good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after another No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fantasy player.   _____  Tip of the Week Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves?

Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre s favorite target i=n the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sha=rpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we hi=ghly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his =current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he s just not =good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers= will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after an=other No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fa=ntasy player.  =09    Tip of the Week      Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start =giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive optio=n the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk a=fter five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes= will continue to be a productive player all season.   =09  This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You ll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI: I am stuck on my last starter. Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the season.G.G.: Alexander has been a revelation in his first two starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA: Should I start Rod Gardner or Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is looking better each week.G.G.: Gardner s huge day means two things. One, he gains instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He ll be facing Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week. Neither player looks like a great start, but we ll go with Hilliard because of his experience and continuing improvement.John Kersey, Denver, CO: I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB - Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?G.G: Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.MVP.comNFL Fans - Save 10% on team caps! Represent your team in afitted, adjustable or logo cap.

Sometimes, emotions override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle. And in divisional games, big players do well. Don t be surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.SPORTING NEWSSubscribe to The Sporting News now for a low $0.99 per issue AND get a FREE Stainless Steel Thermo-Bottle!

You ll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI I am stuck on my last starter. Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the season. Answer - GG Alexander has been a revelation in his first two starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems. Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA Should I start Rod Gardner or Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is looking better each week. Answer - GG Gardner s huge day means two things. One, he gains instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He ll be facing Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week.

Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB - Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?

The Power Authorityhas aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent toapprove contracts as soon as possible. Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, thePower Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids untilits November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken untilthe Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate hasbeen resolved. Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission s rejectionof the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority toexercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/orto implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR scredit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalizedthe Power Authority cannot sign contracts. Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intentto purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, aswell as 400 MW generated by wind. With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll,provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the PowerAuthority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation.Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut ofelectricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be anet short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electricgenerators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who haveno real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to servecustomers within the State. He believes that the short-term contractsand spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supplyshortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed throughTime-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demandside management, renewables and peakers.

Currently, I am preparing to fax a copy of our confirmation on the deal to CMS Field Services,  Again, it is not an executed copy, but I am assuming they may not have sent it back.  Furthermore, the CMS Field Services scheduler has told me that they don t even schedule any Trunkline deals.Considering all of this, I am assuming the worst - that unless we can provide a trader name etc. they will short pay on this deal.  So, do you know who represented us with CMS on this deal any one that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  We are getting ready to settle for Sep prod so any help asap would be appreciated.Scott5-7213 -----Original Message-----From: \tDozier, Scott  Sent:\tThursday, October 18, 2001 12:21 PMTo:\tDonohoe, TomSubject:\tRE: CMS Deal #1027152They do not recognize that deal at all.The most recent name and number is a Conoco trader.

The way that I see this happening is that we will buy the power from Cogentrix at their bus and then sell to a Counter Party at the same bus. We will keep our share of the profit and pay Cogentrix their share.  If there is no profit then we will pay them whatever the sell goes for.  Example being:  If the Bogie is $35 and they want us to sell power and all we can get is $30, then we will pay Cogentrix $30.  There may be times where we have to procure transmission.

When we haveconsidered central banks or government agencies for membership in the past,consideration has focused on the nature of the applicant s derivativesactivities, its regulatory role and the type of information they are likelyto obtain from ISDA. Because of their derivatives activities, we havegenerally admitted these applicants (e.g., the Kingdoms of Belgium, Denmarkand Sweden, the Reserve Banks of South Africa and New Zealand). We have evenadmitted the Bank for International Settlements as a member. In general, welet them know that they may not be able to receive the full range of ISDAmaterials (e.g., draft comment letters or position papers) and that theremay be a need to exclude them from certain committees or discussions. In previous Board discussions, a higher degree of concern has been expressedif, theoretically, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank ofEngland or similarly influential central banks were to apply for membership.These central banks typically have a greater degree of involvement in theregulatory debates (particularly on capital) and are better positioned toinfluence the process. Since some of those previous debates, the regulatory role of the Bank ofEngland has diminished and the role of the Financial Services Authority hascorrespondingly increased. The Bank of England still plays the traditionalcentral bank roles of controller of the money supply, dealing in the marketand lender of last resort, but the supervisory role has shifted to the FSA.

When wehaveconsidered central banks or government agencies for membership in the past,consideration has focused on the nature of the applicant s derivativesactivities, its regulatory role and the type of information they are likelyto obtain from ISDA. Because of their derivatives activities, we havegenerally admitted these applicants (e.g., the Kingdoms of Belgium, Denmarkand Sweden, the Reserve Banks of South Africa and New Zealand). We haveevenadmitted the Bank for International Settlements as a member. In general, welet them know that they may not be able to receive the full range of ISDAmaterials (e.g., draft comment letters or position papers) and that theremay be a need to exclude them from certain committees or discussions.In previous Board discussions, a higher degree of concern has beenexpressedif, theoretically, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank ofEngland or similarly influential central banks were to apply formembership.These central banks typically have a greater degree of involvement in theregulatory debates (particularly on capital) and are better positioned toinfluence the process.Since some of those previous debates, the regulatory role of the Bank ofEngland has diminished and the role of the Financial Services Authority hascorrespondingly increased. The Bank of England still plays the traditionalcentral bank roles of controller of the money supply, dealing in the marketand lender of last resort, but the supervisory role has shifted to the FSA.In light of these developments, but recognizing the concerns previouslyexpressed on central bank membership, I would appreciate your views on theapplication of the Bank of England. We have also had overtures from theHongKong Monetary Authority regarding membership although we have not receivedan application.Please share your views with the other members of the Board.Bob------------------------------------------------------------------------For more information about Barclays Capital, pleasevisit our web site at http://www.barcap.com.Internet communications are not secure and therefore the BarclaysGroup does not accept legal responsibility for the contents of thismessage.

Later today I had 2 fillings done and my dentist accidentally anesthisized the wrong side of my mouth...TWICE...bc we got to talking about baking and the first round of shots wore off....then after the second round he realized that he was working on the wrong side.  Not good!  You should tell this to Phillip.  We have the same dentist.  It was actually not too bad but I m super groggy.Hope all is well at work.  I can t believe the stock price.  I almost fell over today when I saw it.

To date, what we have obtained from London are the self assessments prepared by Operations and will receive copies of EAS/AA reports upon their completion (expected end-Nov).  - Each doorstepping team has had a conference call with EAS to ensure the doorstep team fully understands what has been done to date around the trading controls and where possible issues lie. We are using the reports noted above as a background for these discussions.- The doorstep teams are all planning to use AA/EAS s deal test results (the only exception to this is Essen, where we feel that additional sampling should be done).  - With the exception of metals (recycling & London) & EOTT, RAC will take on a consulting only role.- As far as the video conference idea was concerned we felt that if the doorstep team was willing to travel that would be the best way to perform the doorstep.  This is because we feel that there is really no substitute for being in the location to hear side comments, feel what morale is like etc. Lastly, we have talked to EAS about adding some procedures on to the testing AA is performing, however, they feel they can not take on any additional work.  This is primarily because AA got a late start this year and is feeling challenged to complete their work.

Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.

Absent the charge, the Commission would need to address what kind of renewals should be covered by any potential prohibition against renewals.  Prohibited renewals could include (1) renewal of contracts whose terms expire without any provisions for extension; and (2) renegotiation within the contract term of any material term or condition of the contract, including price.  The Commission would also need to consider whether an interim prohibition on renewals is needed to stop renegotiations or renewals that are very likely underway already, pending final Commission action.    -----Original Message-----From: \tSmith, Mike  Sent:\tWednesday, November 07, 2001 10:10 AMTo:\tMara, SusanCc:\tDasovich, Jeff; Steffes, James D.; Frazier, Lamar; Blachman, JeremySubject:\tRE: CA Extenstions/Amendmentsthanks.  this is really important to the restructures we are working on.From:\tSusan J Mara/ENRON@enronXgate on 11/07/2001 12:07 PMTo:\tMike D Smith/HOU/EES@EES, Jeff Dasovich/ENRON@enronXgate, James D Steffes/ENRON@enronXgatecc:\tLamar Frazier/HOU/EES@EES, Jeremy Blachman/ENRON@enronxgate Subject:\tRE: CA Extenstions/AmendmentsSCE and PG&E have raised these questions.

The Bear Stearns Companies is an example of the use of corporate guaranties for the credit business.  Originally, Bear required a guaranty for an ENA account (holding credit positions); but that guaranty was terminated when the positions were transferred to an Enron Credit Inc. account at Bear with a new ENE guaranty.  There may be a few others but we d have to conduct a file review.ECT Europe Finance, Inc. is owned 100% by ENA.

Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they re simply in chronological order.The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  Specific points:EES will be a part of the new company.  Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for  very little  additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE  has sufficient liquidity , ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  In what was termed a \"new approach\", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  Lay says that Enron had other options,  particularly financial .All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be  pretty big , but that the companies feel they re able to appropriately value this exposure.Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.Dynegy says that  several  internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there s absolutely nothing else out there.Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had  close to a billion  in cash.  Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that  our backs are not against the wall , and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.McMahon says  no comment  to WSJ article indicating that ENE s banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won t be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.Watson says that the  creative financing  surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that,  frankly , DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by  Enron s top three executives , who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy s deliberations on proceeding with the merger.Watson/Doty said that they re NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron s books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron s assets or businesses.  Dynegy s lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a  blunt instrument  under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron s total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.McMahon adds that there  could  be more restatements, but he  does not expect  there to be more restatements.ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.Initial reaction of ratings agencies  very positive  to combined entities.  McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.Dynegy s earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a  25% haircut  to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy s books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a  very very substantial  portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.ChevronTexaco s investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco s investment is now at a  more substantial  discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get  different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better .  (No further clarification given).Whalley believes that  we ll retain  the Enron traders and marketers. They re used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are  very excited  by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that  to the extent necessary, yes. Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he s a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.Give me a call if you d like me to try to clarify any of these comments.Patrick Tuckerx3-3055"}, {"messageId": "ea216b24e6d1d1b", "subject": "FW: Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call", "sender": "f..keavey@enron.com", "time": "2001-11-12T08:36:57-08:00", "recipients": [{"email": "f..brawner@enron.com", "type": "TO"}], "body": ""}, {"messageId": "ea216c064e46e58", "subject": "FW: Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call", "sender": "john.hodge@enron.com", "time": "2001-11-12T08:37:55-08:00", "recipients": [{"email": "scott.neal@enron.com", "type": "TO"}], "body": " -----Original Message-----From: \tTucker, Patrick  Sent:\tMonday, November 12, 2001 10:25 AMTo:\tPollan, Sylvia S.; Culotta, Lindsay; Murrell, Russell E; Plachy, Denver; Cuilla, Martin; Storey, Geoff; Yawapongsiri, Virawan; Mahmassani, Souad; Donohoe, Tom; Ruscitti, Kevin; Shively, Hunter S.; Lewis, Andrew H.; Giron, Darron C.; Frihart, Bryant; Tucker, Patrick; Roberts, Linda; Luce, Laura; Hogan, Irena D.; Vickers, Frank; Williams, Jason (Trading); Mims, Patrice L.; Simpson, James; Hodge, John; Keavey, Peter F.; Mckay, Brad; Mckay, Jonathan; Pereira, Susan W.; Pimenov, Vladi; Ring, Andrea; Savvas, Leonidas; Townsend, Judy; Versen, Victoria; Barbe, Robin; Concannon, Ruth; Goodell, Scott; Jones, David; Kaiser, Jared; Loving, Scott; Bates, Kimberly; Muhl, Gil; Smith, Maureen; Smith, Shauywn; Taylor, Craig; Willis, JimSubject:\tHighlights from this morning s ENE/DYN analyst conference callListened in on the analyst call this morning.

Doty adds that,  frankly , DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by  Enron s top three executives , who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy s deliberations on proceeding with the merger.Watson/Doty said that they re NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron s books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron s assets or businesses.  Dynegy s lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a  blunt instrument  under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron s total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.McMahon adds that there  could  be more restatements, but he  does not expect  there to be more restatements.ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.Initial reaction of ratings agencies  very positive  to combined entities.  McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.Dynegy s earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a  25% haircut  to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy s books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a  very very substantial  portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.ChevronTexaco s investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco s investment is now at a  more substantial  discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get  different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better .  (No further clarification given).Whalley believes that  we ll retain  the Enron traders and marketers. They re used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are  very excited  by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that  to the extent necessary, yes. Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he s a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.Give me a call if you d like me to try to clarify any of these comments.Patrick Tuckerx3-3055"}, {"messageId": "ea21775524ed480", "subject": "FW: Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call", "sender": "scott.neal@enron.com", "time": "2001-11-12T08:50:16-08:00", "recipients": [{"email": "chuck.ames@enron.com", "type": "TO"}], "body": " -----Original Message-----From: \tHodge, John  Sent:\tMonday, November 12, 2001 10:38 AMTo:\tNeal, ScottSubject:\tFW: Highlights from this morning s ENE/DYN analyst conference call -----Original Message-----From: \tTucker, Patrick  Sent:\tMonday, November 12, 2001 10:25 AMTo:\tPollan, Sylvia S.; Culotta, Lindsay; Murrell, Russell E; Plachy, Denver; Cuilla, Martin; Storey, Geoff; Yawapongsiri, Virawan; Mahmassani, Souad; Donohoe, Tom; Ruscitti, Kevin; Shively, Hunter S.; Lewis, Andrew H.; Giron, Darron C.; Frihart, Bryant; Tucker, Patrick; Roberts, Linda; Luce, Laura; Hogan, Irena D.; Vickers, Frank; Williams, Jason (Trading); Mims, Patrice L.; Simpson, James; Hodge, John; Keavey, Peter F.; Mckay, Brad; Mckay, Jonathan; Pereira, Susan W.; Pimenov, Vladi; Ring, Andrea; Savvas, Leonidas; Townsend, Judy; Versen, Victoria; Barbe, Robin; Concannon, Ruth; Goodell, Scott; Jones, David; Kaiser, Jared; Loving, Scott; Bates, Kimberly; Muhl, Gil; Smith, Maureen; Smith, Shauywn; Taylor, Craig; Willis, JimSubject:\tHighlights from this morning s ENE/DYN analyst conference callListened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they re simply in chronological order.The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  Specific points:EES will be a part of the new company.  Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for  very little  additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE  has sufficient liquidity , ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  In what was termed a \"new approach\", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  Lay says that Enron had other options,  particularly financial .All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be  pretty big , but that the companies feel they re able to appropriately value this exposure.Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.Dynegy says that  several  internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there s absolutely nothing else out there.Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had  close to a billion  in cash.  Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that  our backs are not against the wall , and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.McMahon says  no comment  to WSJ article indicating that ENE s banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won t be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.Watson says that the  creative financing  surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that,  frankly , DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.
